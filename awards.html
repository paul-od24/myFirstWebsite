     <h3>Kane on winning player of the month</h3>
         "I go into every game trying to give 120 per cent for the team and that’s just the way football is. It doesn’t change the way I play or the way I think. It would be wrong to do that. I go into every game trying to give my best for the team and the club. And try and focus on that." - Tottenham Striker Harry Kane  <br>
